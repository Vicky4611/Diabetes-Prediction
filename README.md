This project focuses on developing a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm
Utilized the diabetes dataset to develop a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis. Employed preprocessing techniques with Pandas and NumPy to ensure data quality and consistency
Implemented the Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm to train the model. This enabled accurate classification of individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic
